Title: Analytic Solutions for (Ground-Water) Boussinesq Equation
Type: Package
Depends: R (>= 2.10)
Author: Emanuele Cordano
Description: A collection of R functions were implemented
        from published and available analytic solutions for the
        One-Dimensional Boussinesq Equation (ground-water). In
        particular, the function "beq.lin()" is the analytic solution of
        the linearized form of Boussinesq Equation between two
        different head-based boundary (Dirichlet) conditions;
        "beq.song" is the non-linear power-series analytic solution of
        the motion of a wetting front over a dry bedrock (Song at al,
        2007, see complete reference on function documentation).
        Bugs/comments/questions/collaboration of any kind are warmly
        welcomed.
